# About This Project
This python project is a simple "Russian Roulette" game using Python's Random module. The Random module is used determine where the bullet is. I plan to make different difficuties by increasing or decreasing the generator's range, as I found out that not all revolvers are six-shooters. Maybe also a custom difficulty so you can make a game as long (or as short) as possible.

# Future Plans
I'm not sure how long I can work on something consistently. If I can, maybe I'll convert this to something like a visual novel? I heard there's Renpy, a game engine for Visual Novel that uses Python. I'm not sure how suitable it'll be, it might just work.
